# cs4084 ChatApp
## Introduction
Our project is a cultural multimedia platform and mobile messaging application for social enthusiasts. 
They can read other users' posts, if they like the author's posts, they can add them as friends,
and they can chat with them privately. Users can choose their favorite channels to publish posts,
and the app will provide the function of obtaining news and friends by location. So they can search
for nearby users and get news around them. Of course, they can turn off location and set privacy. 
If you encounter difficulties, you can solve it by contacting the developer's email.
