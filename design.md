# Technical Design of Chatapp
We use the 

* Authentication(Firebase)

* Firebase to store the user information and notifications,

* Messaging

* App call camera,

* Link to the local News,

* Use the Google Map API,

* Compare user location and show the nearby users,

* When user send request, the other one would receive the notification,

* Installs / builds without issues (API level 29)

  Extra points for also testing on API level 21 (Lollipop)



In the future, if I improve the program, I will better beautify the UI design of the program,
increase the calling function of the SIM card, and add file and picture transmission functions to the chat.
